Uniset: Hacking
===============

How to compile from Git repository for hacking:

    $ git clone http://git.moria.us/uniset.git/
    $ cd uniset
    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure --enable-warnings=-Werror CFLAGS='-O0 -ggdb'
    $ make

Requirements
------------

* GNU Autotools
* C99 compiler (both GCC and Clang are supported)
* A copy of the Unicode data files

Code style
----------

Use a style similar to K&R.  Indentation is four spaces.  Limit width
to 78 columns.  Function return types go on a separate line.  Within
parentheses, line up indentation with the parentheses.  On expressions
split across multiple lines, put operators at the ends of the lines.

Errors are handled by printing a message to stderr and aborting the
program.

The program should be Valgrind-clean and should not generate warning
messages during compilation.  Both statements should hold with both
GCC and clang at all optimization levels.  As stated above, developers
should use '-Werror' when compiling.  Do not put '-Werror' in CFLAGS,
it will cause the 'configure' script to break.

Unused argument warnings are suppressed as follows:

    void
    my_cool_function(int unused_param)
    {
        (void)unused_param;
    }

Future versions of compilers may introduce new warning diagnostics.
C'est la vie.  Fix them as they appear rather than disabling the
warning.
